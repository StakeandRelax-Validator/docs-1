# Dataverse Gateways

OKP4 Dataverse Gateways enable anyone to:
- Interact with
- Build into
- Share & Contribute to
- Benefit & earn from the Dataverse.

## Wallets/ID

To manage identities and associated assets circulating in the OKP4 Ecosystem ($KNOW and other coins that will emerge in the future), a non-custodial wallet application is necessary.

It means that the user controls his keys.

This enables anyone to:

- Create a private key and wallet
- Import/export identities from/to other SSI systems (self-sovereign identity)
- Control assets on the OKP4 Ecosystem (send, stake, swap)
- Send assets out of the OKP4 Ecosystem
- Create and manage multisig wallets
- Control datasets and services indexed in the Ecosystem
- Control participation in Data Spaces
- Vote on DAO governance
- Vote on Data Space governance if eligible
- Curate data and services
- Create and interact with smart contracts

Cosmos-native wallets such as [Keplr](https://wallet.keplr.app) will be able to perform most of these functions.

But functional doesn't mean optimal.

In terms of UX, many OKP4-specific actions and features will be necessary.

What if you could automatically import web2 platform data into your sovereign wallet while you interact with apps and pages in your browser? What if you could watch your data usage and token analytics in real time in your wallet? What if you could navigate across graphs of your contributions? And many other data-specific features that generic-purpose wallets can't cover.

The OKP4 Wallet will take the form of a web page and a dedicated browser extension. It will be extended to a mobile application.

## Portal

The OKP4 Portal is a web app which allows to navigate between all the OKP4 ecosystem. It aggregates the Dataverse gateways such as wallets, explorers, dataset deposit, workflow builder, block explorer and more.

The portal is open (especially for content and support) and the identification of users is enabled by the wallet. 

Through the OKP4 Portal, a user is informed in real time of the activities related to the Data Space of which he is a member and the digital resources he shares. Thus, users follow their contribution to the knowledge creation and the associated retributions.

The Portal is customized according to membership in different Data Spaces and the user's roles in those spaces.

## Data Space editor

The Data Space editor allows to create his own Data Space easily. 

Through the creation process of a new dataspace, besides the name, description, and tags, one can either use an existing governance template or create its authority using a current token (i.e., the KNOW) or not.

![Governance_interface_1](/img/content/whitepaper/Governance_interface1.webp)

![Governance_interface_2](/img/content/whitepaper/Governance_interface2.webp)

The governance rules of a dataspace can be built using a public template, its own library of dataspaces or custom blocks. For example, it is possible to define the rules of access control of data spaces, datasets and services, the token used, or the token amount. Data management can also be defined depending on the format, size or sectors desired. Other elements such as services management, business model, and governance can be set up. Once created, the data space is available on the OKP4 Explorer. A search tool is used to look for datasets, services, and data spaces.
 

## Explorer

The OKP4 Explorer is a feature of the portal which lists the digital resources declared in the protocol.

As a reminder, a dataset or a service can participate in several Data Spaces while being stored at source.

A user can see all digital resources of all the Data Spaces, that is to say of the Dataverse. The user can apply different filters such as type (dataset or service), date of declaration, tags, spatial or temporal coverage.

The Explorer includes a search engine and a recommendation system.

Several visualizations are available:

### Card view

### List view

### Knowledge Graph

The knowledge graph represents the link between the digital resources (datasets and services) to create knowledge. It allows to visualize the contribution of datasets and services in the generation of new knowledge. This knowledge is expressed by a [formal ontology](okp4-blockchain#okp4-ontology).

The key features of the Knowledge Graph visualization is to:

- Visualize all the datasets and services registered in a Data Space and more extensively in the Dataverse
- Visualize and understand the interaction between them and the _genealogy_ of a dataset from other digital resources
- Explore the contribution of each dataset and service in the creation of a knowledge

For instance:

<Graphviz
  options={{
    width: '90%',
    height: '100%'
  }}
  className="text--center graph-svg-container"
  dot={kgSample}
/>

Depending on the governance rules of the Data Space, and depending on the rights of the user exploring the knowledge graph, some elements and the metadata may be visible or not.

## Datasets Deposit

OKP4 Datasets Deposit is a Web3.0 interface that allows Data Providers to register datasets into the OKP4 Protocol. 

Data Providers are asked to fill in the contextual metadata of the dataset referenced in the blockchain. This information is essential to explain how a dataset is produced, the nature of the information it contains, the application domain it refers to, and the license that applies. Filling in this metadata will improve the ranking of a dataset in the search engine of the Explorer.

Note that a Data Provider is not necessarily the creator of the dataset. He acts as a publisher if it has permission to reference it in the protocol.

Each dataset deposit is a transaction submitted to the protocol that must be signed by a wallet, and it is the responsibility of the Data Provider to pay fees related to the execution of this transaction.

## Metadata extraction

Each dataset referenced in the OKP4 protocol is described by a set of metadata in the form of an [ontology](/whitepaper/okp4-blockchain#okp4-ontology) that is recorded on-chain.

This metadata set is fundamental in the protocol since it allows anyone to have a precise and complete description of the datasets registered in the protocol, according to multiple facets: descriptive, administrative, structural... Moreover, the different processing applied to the datasets through the services materializes, in the ontology, a [knowledge graph](/whitepaper/dataverse-gateways#knowledge-graph) giving a complete understanding of the way the knowledge is created.

When a new dataset is registered, the protocol takes care of the execution of the metadata extraction in order to qualify and characterize the dataset automatically. For this, different specialized services are invoked to perform the metadata extraction. These services are provided by OKP4, but can also be completed by any Service Provider.

For instance:

**Descriptive metadata**
> - Name of the dataset
> - Date of creation  
> - Keywords

**Structural metadata**
> - Files list part of the dataset
> - Name, Size and Type of files 
> - Structure of the files, for instance:
>   - Headers with their types for CSV files
>   - Width, Height, Bits per pixels, etc. for Image files

All metadata are public by default and freely accessible by the simple fact that they are stored in the OKP4 blockchain which is public and permissionless. However, the protocol provides for the expression of visibility rights that are interpreted by the various Web3.0 apps (e.g. [the Portal](/whitepaper/dataverse-gateways#portal)) to filter the information displayed to users. These rights are:

- Public (by default)
- Authorized to particular users
- Private

## Workflow builder

The workflow builder is a dataverse gateway to set a workflow between several digital resources shared within a data space so as to create a new knowledge. 
Before running the workflow, the OKP4 protocol checks if all the rules are respected. If so, the knowledge is created and automatically registered in the protocol. 



## Other applications

### OKP4 Block Explorer

Block explorers are tools that help you understand what is happening in a blockchain. The OKP4 open-source Blockchain Explorer goes further than other explorers in the Cosmos Ecosystem by making it possible for everyone to discover, understand and visualize all transactions that have been committed on the OKP4 mainnet network according to their business dimension:

- Data Space creation
- Data deposit and registration
- Data service executions
- Workflow executions
- Metadata (ontology)
- Rulebook
- ...

### OKP4 Discord Bot

The [OKP4 Discord Bot](https://github.com/okp4/discord-bot/) is a general-purpose open-source bot that facilitates the integration of any blockchain of the Cosmos Ecosystem into a [Discord](https://discord.com/) server.

The functionality offered by the bot is quite broad and covers a lot of features:

- requesting tokens for a testnet [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/)
- consultation of blockchain transactions
- consultation of wallet balances
- consultation of application states of modules or smart contracts
- interaction with smart-contracts
- ...

and more specificallt for the OKP4 blockchain:

- consultation of data spaces, including governance rules
- consultation of the progress of a workflow execution
- consultation of datset and service metadata
- ...
